Otherwise he takes the new empty box and continues the process above. If he has no empty boxes and there is at least one object not in some box then Maksim cannot pack the chosen set of objects.\\n\\nMaksim wants to know the maximum number of objects he can pack by the algorithm above. To reach this target, he will throw out the leftmost object from the set until the remaining set of objects can be packed in boxes he has. Your task is to say the maximum number of objects Maksim can pack in boxes he has.\\n\\nEach time when Maksim tries to pack the objects into the boxes, he will make empty all the boxes he has before do it (and the relative order of the remaining set of objects will not change).\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^9$) — the number of objects, the number of boxes and the size of each box.\\n\\nThe second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le k$), where $a_i$ is the size of the $i$-th object.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint the maximum number of objects Maksim can pack using the algorithm described in the problem statement.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n5 2 6\\n5 2 1 4 2\\n\\nOutput\\n4\\n\\nInput\\n5 1 4\\n4 2 3 4 1\\n\\nOutput\\n1\\n\\nInput\\n5 3 3\\n1 2 3 1 1\\n\\nOutput\\n5\\n\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first example Maksim can pack only $4$ objects.

The fridge has $s$ slots, each with a capacity for $d$ bottles of soda, and you have $n$ new soda bottles to add to the fridge. The sodas currently in the fridge are all nice and cold, but the new ones are not and need to be cooled in the fridge for a while until they are ready to drink. \\n\\nYou can only refill the fridge from the front, so in an ideal world, you would first take out all the sodas currently in the fridge, then put in the $n$ new ones, and then put the old and cold sodas in front of the new ones. But in an ideal world you would also not have two exams and a homework deadline coming. You are simply way too busy to do all this work.\\n\\nInstead, you are going to just put the new bottles in the front of the fridge and hope for the best. However, you can still to be clever about which slots to put the new sodas in. Each time a student comes for a soda, they will take one from the front of a uniformly random non-empty slot in the fridge.

Connecting these villages to one another is a series of roads, always running directly between two villages and allowing travel in both directions. Due to the treacherous landscape, building these roads is expensive, so the minimum number of roads have been constructed such that each village can reach every other village via a sequence of roads. \\n\\nTrade between these villages is very important, since not every village has access to the same supply of natural resources. Many villages produce the same resource, however, so it is useful for villages to know their relative distance to other villages so that they can choose trading partners to minimize overall trading costs. Note that the distance between two villages $a$ and $b$ is the sum of the lengths of the individual roads on the shortest path that connects $a$ and $b$.\\n\\nA project has been underway to compute the distance between every pair of villages. This information has been incorporated in a table, along with a map that shows the layout of villages and roads that run between them. You have been assigned the task of distributing the table and map to all the villages for the betterment of the regional economy.\\n\\nUnfortunately, not long after you were given this task, a gust of wind blew the map right out of your hand and into the countryside. Despite your best efforts of searching for it, you have been unable to locate it. You know that you could visit all the villages to reconstruct the map and THEN start distributing the map and table, but this will take twice as long as the original task and the villages will be very displeased with you. You wonder, maybe it’s possible to reconstruct the map given only the table?\\n\\n-----Input-----\\nThe first line of input will contain the integer $n$ ($2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2500$), the number of villages in this region. The next $n$ lines will contain $n$ integers each. The $j^{\\\\rm th}$ integer of the $i^{\\\\rm th}$ line is the distance from village $i$ to village $j$. All distances are greater than zero unless $i = j$, less than $10^7$, and it is guaranteed that the distance from village $i$ to village $j$ is the same as the distance from village $j$ to village $i$.\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nFor each test case, output $n-1$ lines with two integers $u$ and $v$ on each line, indicating that there is a road connecting villages $u$ and $v$ in this region.
